          This project is about TWITTER SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS using machine learning algorithm. People make judgments about the world around them when they are living in the society. They make positive and negative attitudes about people, products, places and events. These types of attitudes can be considered as sentiments. Sentiment analysis is the study of automated techniques for extracting sentiments from written languages. Growth of social media has resulted in an explosion of publicly available, user generated text on the World Wide Web. These data and information can potentially be utilized to provide real-time insights into the sentiments of people.
